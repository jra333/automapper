[Automapper](https://github.com/jra333/automapper/tree/main/automapper_app_demo) is a Streamlit-based web application designed to automate the processing, review, and archival of file submissions using AI-powered predictions. It integrates with Snowflake for data storage, staging, and user authentication, while leveraging a fine-tuned T5 model from Hugging Face Transformers for generating business-critical data mapping.
